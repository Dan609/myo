Data and scripts used to generate the statistical analyses of protein colocalization, cell shape, F-actin fractality, and cell motility data.

## R scripts:

**CI.R** The proportion of cells with pronounced activity of *beta*-galactosidase during MSCWJ-1 cell line cultivation.

**coloc.R** Statistical analysis of colocalozation coefficients.

**traj_analysis_win.R** Cell movement tracks analysis.

**traj_analysis_mac.R** Mac version differs in path selection function.

**lmfrac.R** Actin cytoskeleton fractality analysis.

**shape.R** Cell shape analysis.


## Ipython notebook:

**significance_plot.ipynb** Multiple pairwise comparison of Myosin-9/F-actin colocalization data from long-term cultivation of WJMSC-1 cells.
Probe - passage number.
Rval,tM1,tM2,bTau,Rs - colocalization coefficients calculated in ImageJ Coloc2 plugin.


## Data:
