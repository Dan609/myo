# Cytoskeletal and motility changes in human umbilical cord MSCs associated with nuclear-cytoplasmic Rho–ê redistribution during replicative senescence.

Data and scrips used to generate the statistical analyses of protein colocalization and cell motility data.


## R scripts:

**CI.R** The proportion of cells with pronounced activity of *beta*-galactosidase during MSCWJ-1 cell line cultivation.

**coloc.R** Statistical analysis of colocalozation coefficients.

**traj_analysis.R** Cell movement tracks analysis.


## Ipython notebook:
